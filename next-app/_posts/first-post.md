# Welcome

To avoid a redundant introduction, you can learn more about me and what my interests are by navigating to “About Me” at the top. I want to take this time as an opportunity to introduce why I have started this web project.

Learning is my passion, and it is at the core of most of my decisions.  It can be hard to dedicate time to learning what I want to learn. Between schooling, work, and life people learn a lot but oftentimes since you lack a stake or interest in what you learn you quickly forget it. My purpose in this website is to track, manage and hold myself accountable to learning new technology and concepts that I find interesting.

# What to Expect

In the coming days I will continue making edits and modifications to the core of the site. Alongside this I will release my first real blog post on how I set up and built out the site. I plan to outline the technology stack, the steps I took and what guided my decision making process. In general I plan to regularly introduce myself to a new skill or technology and outline how and why I chose to learn it. There is a possibility that I segment off specific projects into a portfolio section but I plan on keeping the blog format for the foreseeable future.

# Conclusion

Thank you for finding the time to follow along. I hope this gives you some inspiration to pursue your personal interest in learning something new.
